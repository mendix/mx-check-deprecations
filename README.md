# Mendix Deprecation checker for widgets

**This tool is in beta**

It will check your .MPK (widget) files for possible Javascript deprecations that will break your widget in the new [Mendix 6 release](https://world.mendix.com/display/ReleaseNotes/6.0.0). Check the [Mendix 6 client API](https://apidocs.mendix.com/6/client/), as well as the [documented deprecations](https://world.mendix.com/display/refguide6/Moving+from+5+to+6#Movingfrom5to6-RemovedDeprecatedFunctionality).
